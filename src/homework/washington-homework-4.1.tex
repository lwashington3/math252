In Problems 1--4 the given family of functions is the general solution of the differential equation on the indicated interval. Find a member of the family that is a solution of the initial-value problem.
\begin{problems}
	\problem \[ y = c_{1}e^{x} + c_{2}e^{-x}, (-\infty, \infty); y'' - y = 0, y(0) = 0, y'(0)=1 \]
	\problem \[ y = c_{1}e^{4x} + c_{2}e^{-x}, (-\infty, \infty); y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0, y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 2 \]
\end{problems}

\begin{problems}[start=5]
    \problem Given that $y=c_{1} + c_{2}x^{2}$ is a two-parameter family of solutions of $xy'' - y' = 0$ on the interval $(-\infty, \infty)$, show that constants $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ cannot be found so that a member of the family satisfies the initial conditions $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=1$. Explain why this does not violate Theorem 4.1.1.
	\problem Find two members of the family of solutions in \hyperref[prb:5]{Problem 5} that satisfy the initial conditions $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=0$.
\end{problems}

In Problems 9 and 10 find an interval centered about $x=0$ for which the given initial-value problem has a unique solution.
\begin{problems}[start=9]
    \problem \[ (x-2)y'' + 3y = x, y(0)=0, y'(0)=1 \]
\end{problems}
